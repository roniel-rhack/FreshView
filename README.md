FreshView for YouTube™ is a browser extension that hides watched YouTube™ videos, helping you discover fresh content without the clutter of videos you've already seen.

> **Note:** This is a maintained fork of the [original FreshView project](https://github.com/Mandrenkov/FreshView) by [@Mandrenkov](https://github.com/Mandrenkov), which was discontinued in 2023. This version has been updated to Manifest V3 for continued compatibility with modern browsers.
